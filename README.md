Figures 2 and 3, Figures S2-S5, and Tables S2, S3, S12, and S13 rely on restricted-access NHIS data. We obtained access to these data following approval from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which assessed the proposed analyses for possible disclosure risk. Analyses were conducted in the Federal Statistical Research Data Center (RDC) at Stanford University. Restricted-access NHIS data included the same variables as the public data extract, as well as the following additional variables, from 2011 to 2018:

- SADATE	Date Sample Adult Core Section was started
- SAEND	Date Sample Adult section was completed
- USYR	Year respondent came to the U.S.

## ICE Detainers
These restricted-access data on detainers issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement between 2011 and 2018 are provided by Syracuse University's Transactional Access Records Clearinghouse (TRAC). To obtain the data, which were provided to us free of charge as university researchers affiliated with institutions who subscribe to TRAC, others may apply for the data at the following website: https://trac.syr.edu/fellows/. The application process, as described on that website, is the following: 

To facilitate data access for scholarly research, TRAC has set up the TRAC Fellows program. Fellows can be appointed as Fellows In-Residence or as Outside Fellows. How to apply to become a TRAC Fellow and the terms of appointments are briefly described below:

1. Appointments as TRAC Fellows are limited to researchers of subscribing organizations who are bound by the License Agreement governing data use. If collaborating researchers are from different organizations, each organization must be a subscriber. If during the term of appointment the organization does not renew their annual subscription, the appointment automatically terminates.

2. To apply for data access for scholarly research, submit a brief research plan including the proposed analysis, a description of the data needed, the project proposed beginning and end dates, and a list of collaborators and co-authors with their affiliations. If some period in-residence is desired, specify the proposed period and any additional research support needed.

3. TRAC reviews proposals on an on-going basis, and will notify the submitter whether their proposal is accepted, and what if any additional costs would be involved if specialized data sets or other support services are requested.

4. Special data access will be provided with the following understanding:
a. Use will be limited to only that described in the research plan;
b. Data access will not be shared with anyone not listed as a collaborator or co-author in the application;
c. Use of data will terminate automatically if the organization(s) cease to be TRAC subscriber(s).

5. TRAC Fellows receiving special data access agree to provide (i) a 1-2 page synopsis of their research project, and (ii) upon completion, a synopsis including findings, both of which can be published on TRAC's web site. At their discretion, TRAC Fellows may also provide a link to a working paper on another web site, and citation to a publication.

## Google Trends Scores
Publicly available Google Trends data were downloaded from Google Trends (google.com/trends). We searched for the "Immigration" topic, exclusive to the United States, between January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2018. We then downloaded these data in .csv format (immigration_only.csv). In our Supplementary Analyses, we use a similar measure in which we adjust the default Trends option from "Web Search" to "News Search," capturing the "Immigration" topic within news articles. We downloaded these data in .csv format as well (immigration_newssearch.csv).
